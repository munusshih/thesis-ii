#### Assignment

<span>**Due:** Next week / Print Them Out!</span>

<br/>This week is all about Medium!<br/><br/>

This week, choose one of the three directions you discussed and begin developing it using a specific medium.
<br/><br/>
Build a more refined prototype that shows how the medium shapes your concept. Then write a short reflection on what the process revealed. Use the riddle exercise if you feel lost. What the medium offered, what it limited, and how it influenced your idea? Bring both your prototype and reflection to class next week.
<br/><br/>

**Write a few passage accompany your design:**

- Consider how your chosen medium differs from the work of others exploring similar ideas.
- Identify ways to expand, distinguish, and differentiate your contribution.
- Determine the form your argument or idea takes, and if designing an artifact, clarify what it could be and why.
- Describe how your idea translates into a tangible design artifact.
