#### Assignment

<span>**Due:** Next week</span>

<br/>This week is all about Medium!<br/><br/>

Medium is the message. How does the choice of platform, tool, or environment shape your project? From the three possible forms you discussed, choose one direction and begin prototyping it as a way to test your ideas.
Keep it small and sketch-like: the aim is to learn, not to polish. As you work, try pushing into one of four medium tracks—Generative & Poetic Algorithms , Web & Interactive Experiences, Fabrication & Installation or Embodied & Mixed Realities or more.
<br/><br/>
Bring your prototype and a short reflection on what the medium revealed about your concept to share next week.
For each prototype/medium you’ve tested, list out all the affordances of it and what it can offer you.
