<br/>Please [upload your current research proposal here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qJTPCcPUpy9lKTN9KNL1fBt5Pbm2xhZc?usp=drive_link). This week is all about Planning!<br/><br/>

Now we are approaching the end of the semester. We are going to start planning out the final phase of your project. Use the feedback from Crit 2 to identify the next 4 week plan of your project, considering both conceptual and practical implications. We will have a check-in session next week to discuss your plan.
<br/><br/> Keep in mind the following questions as you plan:

- How does your Body of Work get translated, transformed, distributed?
- What edits, selects, and refinements need to be considered?
- How does the display, installation, exhibition, and the location and environment contextualise the work?
- How are you formatting and curating your work for Open Studios at Pfizer?
- How are you seeking to engage your audience in and through the work in this context?
