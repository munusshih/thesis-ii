#### Assignment 1

<a class="button" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PecSkrxEaSGMFy4Jolxjcw13vYCuMOu1?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Upload the Presentation Here</a>

- Drawing inspiration from your body of work, thesis question and the compendium, draft a very rough sketch of your thesis book. Using the 4 different materiality we discussed in class (Forensic, Formal, Distributed, Performative), how would you like to construct your thesis book?
- Is it an academic book? Is it a playful book? Is it a thick book or a thin book? Would it have a digital component? How would the materiality of the book shape the content and the way you present your thesis? The goal of this assignment is to start thinking about the "paratext" of your thesis book, and how the materiality of the book can shape the content and the way you present your thesis.
- Prepare a 5 minute presentation to share your sketch (it cannot be just refernce or just writing, it has to include some sort of visual representation or concept diagram) and your thought process behind it. We will share and critique each other's idea in class next week.
- The idea is to use the "paratext" as a guide to create limitation and constraint for ourselves, and help brainstorm how we create the content of the book. The materiality of the book will shape the content and the way we present our thesis, so it's important to start thinking about it early on in the process.
