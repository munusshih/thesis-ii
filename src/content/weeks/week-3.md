<br/>This week is all about Iterative Prototype!<br/><br/>

This week, you will create a new set of prototypes that build on the insights, surprises, and questions from your first round. Over the next five days, produce another five prototypes that explore unresolved aspects, test assumptions, or extend your previous discoveries.
Work with you buddy and try to think iteratively. For each prototype, write a brief note on what it revealed, what worked, and what unexpected insights emerged. Let it informs the next one. Focus on iterative exploration and knowledge generation.
