#### Class Time

We will be having a check-in session this week to discuss your project plans for the final phase of your work. Please come prepared to share your 5 week plan and any questions or concerns you may have as you move into this next stage of your project development.
<br/><br/>
We're also going to take some time to review the logistics and expectations for Open Studios at Pfizer, ensuring everyone is clear on how to present and engage with the audience effectively.
<br/><br/>
Please use this [//worksheet//](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xEIZvCWIDAtDT-4NJmhsIK6AJ6nd3kieNohyBeyEqQg/edit?usp=sharing) and work in pairs to reflect on your progress so far and outline your plans for the coming weeks.

- We are pleased to announce the 2025 Pfizer Open Studios (formerly known as Graduate Inquiries Exhibition), which is an opportunity for MFA and MS students to share their practice in the form that feels most relevant to them; this event highlights research, process, experimentation and dialogue, in addition to design outcomes.
- Students may display elements of their process, such as sketches, drafts, prototypes, research notes, or experiments, to present a body of work that reflects their current focus and their relevant path to here. This is a moment that marks the movement towards synthesis, where students begin to curate their ideas through form and marks a natural transition towards the body of work that will unfold in the spring semester during Thesis II and Capstone Project.
