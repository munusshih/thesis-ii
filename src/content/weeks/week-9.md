#### Assignment

<br/>This week is all about Worksheet!<br/><br/>

Use the questions in the worksheet to refine your ideas and develop them into a presentation for Crit 2. It should be a quick elevator pitch (5 mins less) while presenting your current research + prototypes.
<br/><br/>

**Worksheet:**

- What is going on in the world related to your topic? → What is your Research Question?
- Why does that matter? → What community is this project serving?
- What you intend to explore through your research and design? → What form are you currently experimenting?
- What's an end goal? What's the impact you're looking for? → Questions you have or need help on?

You are welcome to use any of the techniques we’ve explored in class to explore and advance your concept, though you only need to include them in your presentation if they help illustrate your concept and its trajectory.
<br/><br/>
