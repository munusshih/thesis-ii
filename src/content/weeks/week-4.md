<br/>Crit 1: Research Question!<br/><br/>

This week, you will synthesize your prototype mappings and prior research to formulate a clear, focused research question. This question should highlight 1–3 possible directions your research question could take for the next five weeks of iteration. (iteration 2)
<br/><br/>

- Synthesize your prototype mappings and prior research to formulate a clear, focused research question.
- Reflect on both successes and challenges, including prototypes that worked, those that didn’t, and insights gained from each.
- Highlight 1–3 potential directions your research question could take over the next five weeks of iteration.
- Use [the “riddle” exercise](https://www.figma.com/proto/q8Mqn1nO6zt6qinoR2UVU9/-Thesis-I--Week-4?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=8017-457&viewport=3155%2C1679%2C0.06&t=cn3PscdVNfJ9k0XU-1&scaling=contain&content-scaling=fixed) to reflect on the trajectory of your research: what you’ve explored, discovered, and learned.
- Emphasize how your prototypes and insights inform and shape the research question you are developing.
- Each person will have 7 minutes to present and 7 minutes to receive feedback.
- Print out your materials and bring them to class.
