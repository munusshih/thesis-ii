<a class="button" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i057fWKP3DiBGYuwr3Zlvn3LXIERHjU8?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Upload the Content here</a>

- For this assignment, you will use either markup (.html) or Markdown (.md) to create a structured, readable version of their thesis content. Use any tool you like to write it, [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?tgif=d), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), or any other writing tool that can export to HTML or MD.
- The content needs to include:
  - Annotated table of contents
  - A writing sample that demonstrates the structure and hierarchy of the content. This can be a chapter, a section, or a few paragraphs of your thesis.
  - A detailed writing plan (timeline, outline, or roadmap) for the next 2 months leading up to the thesis submission.
- Using either Bindery.js or InDesign, create a print-ready PDF of your thesis book using the content you created in the first part of the assignment. You cannot just copy and paste the content you wrote in the first part of the assignment. If you're using InDesign, practice using ICML to import your content and format it using InDesign's tools. If you're using Bindery.js, practice using HTML and CSS to format your content and create a visually appealing layout for your thesis book.
