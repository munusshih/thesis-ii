#### Assignment

<span>**Due:** Next week</span>

<br/>This week is all about Feedback!<br/><br/>

Move beyond simply receiving critique. Make feedback itself your design material. Choose a work-in-progress and stage a user test that invites real participants to engage, react, and intervene. Don’t just observe: design the protocol of interaction. Decide how feedback will be elicited, recorded, and re-entered into the work. How do users know what kind of response is desired? What affordances, instructions, or provocations shape what they give back?
<br/><br/>

**Write a few passage accompany your design:**

Your prototype this week should embody feedback as a participatory system. Design a way for others to intervene through annotation, participation, response, or interpretation. Document the process and outcomes: what surfaced that you couldn’t predict? How did your role shift between designer, facilitator, and participant?
<br/><br/>
Your goal is not only to collect reactions, but to design the conditions under which feedback becomes meaningful, situated, and reciprocal.
