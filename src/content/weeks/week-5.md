#### Assignment

<span>**Due:** Next week</span>

<br/>This week is all about Form!<br/><br/>

Use the extremes you have explored as a means to generate forms for your research question. Based on this exploration, identify 3 possibilities for the final form of your project, considering both conceptual and practical implications.
<br/><br/>
If you encounter uncertainty or difficulty in determining these forms, consult your initial prototypes or revisit the mapping axis exercise, as these tools can provide valuable guidance and help clarify your design direction.
<br/><br/>
Your project can take in the shape of any of these:

- as a material form (object, installation, print, etc.),
- as a digital/interactive form (website, code sketch, AR/VR, animation, etc.),
- as a social or performative form (workshop, performance, collective action, event).

If you wish, you can also generate one idea for each of these concepts. We will have an 1-on-1 session next week.
