- For this assignment, you will source the content for you thesis book. This can be a combination of text, images, data, or any other type of content that you think is relevant to your thesis topic. The content needs to be organized and structured in google spreadsehet or any other tool (notion database etc.) that can export to CSV or Excel. You can use any tool you like to source the content, but it needs to be in a format that can be easily utilized later.
- Break your content into different categories or sections, and create a clear hierarchy and structure for the content. Think about what content you can pull from your compendium, your research notes, your interviews, or any other sources you have. The goal of this assignment is to practice sourcing and organizing content for your thesis book, and to create a clear and structured dataset that can be used for the next steps of the thesis process.
- Be prepared to discuss this along in 1-on-1 meetings next week on zoom.
