<br/>This week is all about Prototyping!<br/><br/>

Over the next 5 days, create 5 different simple prototypes for your project—sketches, diagrams, paper mock-ups, role-play, or any low-fidelity form. Make each one distinct. For each prototype, write a sentence or two about what it revealed, what worked, and what surprised you. Focus on exploration and discovery, not polish.<br/><br/>
We’ll share and discuss these in the next session.
