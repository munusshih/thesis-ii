<br/>This week is all about Research!<br/><br/>
Take some time to think about what inspires you and what excites you as a designer or maker. Find a few works, projects, or ideas that catch your attention and write a sentence or two about why they speak to you. Then, jot down a short reflection on any through-lines, patterns, themes, or questions you notice in these inspirations. Finally, make a simple sketch, diagram, or word map of an idea you might want to explore in your thesis.<br/><br/>
We will discuss these next week.
